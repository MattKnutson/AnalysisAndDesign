   During this term, we learned how to read data from a CSV file, load it into a 
 structure, and then use different algorithms to quickly sort, organize, and display the
 data in a particular order to a user. The main three data structures we played around 
 with were vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. During the course, we 
 simultaneously learned how to code the algorithms in C++ and write the pseudocode for
 the algorithms. 
   The amount of time it takes an algorithm to run is a primary reason for 
 understanding data structures. For my final project, I decided to use the binary 
 tree algorithm. It felt like this data structure would be most efficient for 
 organizing data using a unique identifier. I felt this way based on how a binary
 tree stores nodes and how it retrieves those nodes. Although, the other algorithms
 would have worked just fine as well, as they all have similar run times. But, when
 concerned with much larger projects, understanding the data structure time differences
 is essential to writing an efficient application.
   There were many times that I was stuck this term. I did find that writing out
 the pseudocode and using illustrations, helped tremendously when understanding the
 logic of the code. Also, using a little bit of extra spacing while programming helped
 me keep track of what was going on in the program, as I wrote it. During this class, I
 also became much more comfortable using functions from previous code and integrating 
 them into the program Iâ€™m writing. I feel like this will help me develop my own 
 programs quicker and sharpen my debugging skills. I also feel like I am leaving the
 term more organized in the IDE environment and more accurate in my descriptions of the
 code I am writing. I am actually rather impressed with my comfort level in C++ now and
 my ability to produce a rather large, working application!!!
